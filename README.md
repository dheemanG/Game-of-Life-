Contributions of Each Member

Our project was split into four main classes â€“ the Model, the View, the Controller, and the Display class..
The model, which required us to define the cells and specify multiple conditions as per the specific conditions, was handled by Samad. 
The view class (which was the primary design of the GUI) was handled by Chaitanya.
The controller class (which implements ActionListeners which update the view and keep the game running) was handled by Samad and Dheeman. 
The majority of the display class (which initializes the panels, components and adds the necessary listeners to each component) all of the team members in collaboration.
While these points highlight the primary roles of each member, all members have been actively involved in the design of each main class in order to make this project successful. 
In addition to the main features, we as a team also implemented several optional features to improve the Game. The features are as follows:
Slider Component (Scaling, Speed Control)
Randomization (Generate Random Button)
Dark/light Theme
Keyboard Shortcuts (Information provided in About Dialog) for Start,Stop and controlling speed.
About Dialog for Game instructions
